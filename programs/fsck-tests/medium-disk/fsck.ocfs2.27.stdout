@DEVICE@ was run with -f, check forced.
Pass 0a: Checking cluster allocation chains
Pass 0b: Checking inode allocation chains
Pass 0c: Checking extent block allocation chains
Pass 1: Checking inodes and blocks.
[INODE_ALLOC_REPAIR] Inode 16857 is marked as invalid but its position in the inode allocator is marked as in use.  Fix the allocation of this and all future inodes? y
[INODE_BLKNO] Inode read from block 16859 has i_blkno set to 16959.  Set the inode's i_blkno value to reflect its location on disk? y
[INODE_NZ_DTIME] Inode 16860 is in use but has a non-zero dtime. Reset the dtime to 0? y
[INODE_SUBALLOC] Inode 16861 indicates that it was allocated from slot 10 but slot 0's chain allocator covers the inode.  Fix the inode's record of where it is allocated? y
[INODE_SIZE] Inode 16862 has a size of 100 but has 0 bytes of actual data. Correct the file size? y
[INODE_CLUSTERS] Inode 16863 has 0 clusters but its blocks fit in 10 clusters.  Correct the number of clusters? y
Pass 2: Checking directory entries.
[DIRENT_INODE_FREE] Directory entry 'testYJ7LXp' refers to inode number 16857 which isn't allocated, clear the entry? y
[DIRENT_INODE_FREE] Directory entry 'testEWPHr7' refers to inode number 16858 which isn't allocated, clear the entry? y
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity.
Pass 4a: checking for orphaned inodes
Pass 4b: Checking inodes link counts.
[INODE_COUNT] Inode 16864 has a link count of 0 on disk but directory entry references come to 1. Update the count on disk to match? y
All passes succeeded.

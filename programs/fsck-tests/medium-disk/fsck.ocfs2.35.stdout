[TRUNCATE_REC_START_RANGE] Truncate record at offset 0 in truncate log inode 34 starts at cluster 1048586 but there are 1048576 clusters in the volume. Remove this record from the log? y
[TRUNCATE_REC_RANGE] Truncate record at offset 0 in truncate log inode 34 starts at cluster 1048586 and contains 10 clusters.  It can't have this many clusters as this volume only has 1048576 clusters. Remove this record from the log? y
[TRUNCATE_REC_WRAP] Truncate record at offset 1 in truncate log inode 34 starts at cluster 10000 and contains 4294967285 clusters.  It can't have this many clusters as that overflows the number of possible clusters in a volume.  Remove this record from the log? y
[TRUNCATE_REC_RANGE] Truncate record at offset 2 in truncate log inode 34 starts at cluster 17899 and contains 1048586 clusters.  It can't have this many clusters as this volume only has 1048576 clusters. Remove this record from the log? y

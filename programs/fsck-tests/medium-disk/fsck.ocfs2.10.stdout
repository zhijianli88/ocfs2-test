Pass 0a: Checking cluster allocation chains
[CHAIN_HEAD_LINK_RANGE] Chain 0 in allocator inode 11 contains an initial block reference to 1234567 which is out of range.  Clear this reference? y
[CHAIN_BITS] Chain 0 in allocator inode 11 has 14377 bits marked free out of 32256 total bits but the block groups in the chain have 0 free out of 0 total.  Fix this by updating the chain record? y
[CHAIN_EMPTY] Chain 0 in allocator inode 11 is empty.  Remove it from the chain record array in the inode and shift further chains into its place? y
[GROUP_CHAIN] Group descriptor at block 1032192 was found in chain 0 but it claims to be in chain 32. Update the descriptor's recorded chain? y
[CHAIN_GROUP_BITS] Allocator inode 11 has 17911 bits marked used out of 1048576 total bits but the chains have 32 used out of 1016320 total.  Fix this by updating the inode counts? y
[CHAIN_I_CLUSTERS] Allocator inode 11 has 1016320 clusters represented in its allocator chains but has an i_clusters value of 1048576. Fix this by updating i_clusters? y
[CHAIN_I_SIZE] Allocator inode 11 has 1016320 clusters represented in its allocator chain which accounts for 4162846720 total bytes, but its i_size is 4294967296. Fix this by updating i_size? y
[GROUP_EXPECTED_DESC] Block 3 should be a group descriptor for the bitmap chain allocator but it wasn't found in any chains.  Reinitialize it as a group desc and link it into the bitmap allocator? y

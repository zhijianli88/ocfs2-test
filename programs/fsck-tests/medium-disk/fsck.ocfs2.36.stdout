Pass 0a: Checking cluster allocation chains
Pass 0b: Checking inode allocation chains
Pass 0c: Checking extent block allocation chains
Pass 1: Checking inodes and blocks.
[LINK_NULLTERM] The target of symlink inode 16858 isn't null terminated.  Clear the inode? y
[INODE_ALLOC_REPAIR] Inode 16858 is marked as invalid but its position in the inode allocator is marked as in use.  Fix the allocation of this and all future inodes? y
[LINK_SIZE] The target of symlink inode 16859 is 16 bytes long on disk, but i_size is 26 bytes long.  Update i_size to reflect the length on disk? y
[LINK_BLOCKS] The target of symlink inode 16860 fits in 1 blocks but the inode has 2 allocated.  Clear the inode? y
[CLUSTER_ALLOC_BIT] Cluster 17880 is marked in the global cluster bitmap but it isn't in use.  Clear its bit in the bitmap? y
[CLUSTER_ALLOC_BIT] Cluster 17881 is marked in the global cluster bitmap but it isn't in use.  Clear its bit in the bitmap? y
[CLUSTER_ALLOC_BIT] Cluster 17883 is marked in the global cluster bitmap but it isn't in use.  Clear its bit in the bitmap? y
Pass 2: Checking directory entries.
[DIRENT_INODE_FREE] Directory entry 'testzeCDMg' refers to inode number 16858 which isn't allocated, clear the entry? y
[DIRENT_INODE_FREE] Directory entry 'test7hr8Es' refers to inode number 16860 which isn't allocated, clear the entry? y

Pass 0a: Checking cluster allocation chains
[CHAIN_CPG] Global bitmap at block 11 has clusters per group set to 32272 instead of 32256. Fix? y
[CHAIN_GROUP_BITS] Allocator inode 11 has 17911 bits marked used out of 1048576 total bits but the chains have 17879 used out of 32256 total.  Fix this by updating the inode counts? y
[CHAIN_I_CLUSTERS] Allocator inode 11 has 32256 clusters represented in its allocator chains but has an i_clusters value of 1048576. Fix this by updating i_clusters? y
[CHAIN_I_SIZE] Allocator inode 11 has 32256 clusters represented in its allocator chain which accounts for 132120576 total bytes, but its i_size is 4294967296. Fix this by updating i_size? y

Pass 0a: Checking cluster allocation chains
[CHAIN_HEAD_LINK_RANGE] Chain 32 in allocator inode 11 contains an initial block reference to 1048577 which is out of range.  Clear this reference? y
[CHAIN_GROUP_BITS] Allocator inode 11 has 17911 bits marked used out of 1048576 total bits but the chains have 17910 used out of 1032192 total.  Fix this by updating the inode counts? y
[CHAIN_I_CLUSTERS] Allocator inode 11 has 1032192 clusters represented in its allocator chains but has an i_clusters value of 1048576. Fix this by updating i_clusters? y
[CHAIN_I_SIZE] Allocator inode 11 has 1032192 clusters represented in its allocator chain which accounts for 4227858432 total bytes, but its i_size is 4294967296. Fix this by updating i_size? y
[GROUP_EXPECTED_DESC] Block 1032192 should be a group descriptor for the bitmap chain allocator but it wasn't found in any chains.  Reinitialize it as a group desc and link it into the bitmap allocator? y
Pass 0b: Checking inode allocation chains
Pass 0c: Checking extent block allocation chains
Pass 1: Checking inodes and blocks.
Pass 2: Checking directory entries.
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity.

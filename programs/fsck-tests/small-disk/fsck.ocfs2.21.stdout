Pass 0a: Checking cluster allocation chains
[CHAIN_CPG] Global bitmap at block 15 has clusters per group set to 7696 instead of 7680. Fix? y
[CHAIN_GROUP_BITS] Allocator inode 15 has 4741 bits marked used out of 65536 total bits but the chains have 4733 used out of 7680 total.  Fix this by updating the inode counts? y
[CHAIN_I_CLUSTERS] Allocator inode 15 has 7680 clusters represented in its allocator chains but has an i_clusters value of 65536. Fix this by updating i_clusters? y
[CHAIN_I_SIZE] Allocator inode 15 has 7680 clusters represented in its allocator chain which accounts for 31457280 total bytes, but its i_size is 268435456. Fix this by updating i_size? y
[GROUP_EXPECTED_DESC] Block 30720 should be a group descriptor for the bitmap chain allocator but it wasn't found in any chains.  Reinitialize it as a group desc and link it into the bitmap allocator? y
[GROUP_EXPECTED_DESC] Block 61440 should be a group descriptor for the bitmap chain allocator but it wasn't found in any chains.  Reinitialize it as a group desc and link it into the bitmap allocator? y
[GROUP_EXPECTED_DESC] Block 92160 should be a group descriptor for the bitmap chain allocator but it wasn't found in any chains.  Reinitialize it as a group desc and link it into the bitmap allocator? y
[GROUP_EXPECTED_DESC] Block 122880 should be a group descriptor for the bitmap chain allocator but it wasn't found in any chains.  Reinitialize it as a group desc and link it into the bitmap allocator? y
[GROUP_EXPECTED_DESC] Block 153600 should be a group descriptor for the bitmap chain allocator but it wasn't found in any chains.  Reinitialize it as a group desc and link it into the bitmap allocator? y
[GROUP_EXPECTED_DESC] Block 184320 should be a group descriptor for the bitmap chain allocator but it wasn't found in any chains.  Reinitialize it as a group desc and link it into the bitmap allocator? y
[GROUP_EXPECTED_DESC] Block 215040 should be a group descriptor for the bitmap chain allocator but it wasn't found in any chains.  Reinitialize it as a group desc and link it into the bitmap allocator? y
[GROUP_EXPECTED_DESC] Block 245760 should be a group descriptor for the bitmap chain allocator but it wasn't found in any chains.  Reinitialize it as a group desc and link it into the bitmap allocator? y

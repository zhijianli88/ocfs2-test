Pass 0a: Checking cluster allocation chains
[CHAIN_BITS] Chain 0 in allocator inode 15 has 2947 bits marked free out of 7680 total bits but the block groups in the chain have 0 free out of 0 total.  Fix this by updating the chain record? y
[CHAIN_EMPTY] Chain 0 in allocator inode 15 is empty.  Remove it from the chain record array in the inode and shift further chains into its place? y
[GROUP_CHAIN] Group descriptor at block 245760 was found in chain 0 but it claims to be in chain 8. Update the descriptor's recorded chain? y
[CHAIN_GROUP_BITS] Allocator inode 15 has 4741 bits marked used out of 65536 total bits but the chains have 8 used out of 57856 total.  Fix this by updating the inode counts? y
[CHAIN_I_CLUSTERS] Allocator inode 15 has 57856 clusters represented in its allocator chains but has an i_clusters value of 65536. Fix this by updating i_clusters? y
[CHAIN_I_SIZE] Allocator inode 15 has 57856 clusters represented in its allocator chain which accounts for 236978176 total bytes, but its i_size is 268435456. Fix this by updating i_size? y
[GROUP_EXPECTED_DESC] Block 4 should be a group descriptor for the bitmap chain allocator but it wasn't found in any chains.  Reinitialize it as a group desc and link it into the bitmap allocator? y

Pass 0a: Checking cluster allocation chains
[CHAIN_HEAD_LINK_RANGE] Chain 7 in allocator inode 15 contains an initial block reference to 215040 which is out of range.  Clear this reference? y
[CHAIN_HEAD_LINK_RANGE] Chain 8 in allocator inode 15 contains an initial block reference to 245760 which is out of range.  Clear this reference? y
[CHAIN_BITS] Chain 7 in allocator inode 15 has 7679 bits marked free out of 7680 total bits but the block groups in the chain have 0 free out of 0 total.  Fix this by updating the chain record? y
[CHAIN_EMPTY] Chain 7 in allocator inode 15 is empty.  Remove it from the chain record array in the inode and shift further chains into its place? y
[CHAIN_BITS] Chain 7 in allocator inode 15 has 4095 bits marked free out of 4096 total bits but the block groups in the chain have 0 free out of 0 total.  Fix this by updating the chain record? y
[CHAIN_EMPTY] Chain 7 in allocator inode 15 is empty.  Remove it from the chain record array in the inode and shift further chains into its place? y
[CHAIN_GROUP_BITS] Allocator inode 15 has 4741 bits marked used out of 65536 total bits but the chains have 4739 used out of 53760 total.  Fix this by updating the inode counts? y
[CHAIN_I_CLUSTERS] Allocator inode 15 has 53760 clusters represented in its allocator chains but has an i_clusters value of 65536. Fix this by updating i_clusters? y
[CHAIN_I_SIZE] Allocator inode 15 has 53760 clusters represented in its allocator chain which accounts for 220200960 total bytes, but its i_size is 268435456. Fix this by updating i_size? y
[SUPERBLOCK_CLUSTERS] Superblock has clusters set to 46336 instead of 53760. Fix? y

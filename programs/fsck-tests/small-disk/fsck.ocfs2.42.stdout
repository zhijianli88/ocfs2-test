Pass 1: Checking inodes and blocks.
Pass 2: Checking directory entries.
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity.
[DIR_NOT_CONNECTED] Directory inode 16883 isn't connected to the filesystem.  Move it to lost+found? y
[DIR_DOTDOT] Directory inode 16883 is referenced by a dirent in directory 16881 but its '..' entry points to inode 16882. Fix the '..' entry to reference 16881? y
Pass 4a: checking for orphaned inodes

[TRUNCATE_REC_START_RANGE] Truncate record at offset 0 in truncate log inode 38 starts at cluster 65546 but there are 65536 clusters in the volume. Remove this record from the log? y
[TRUNCATE_REC_RANGE] Truncate record at offset 0 in truncate log inode 38 starts at cluster 65546 and contains 10 clusters.  It can't have this many clusters as this volume only has 65536 clusters. Remove this record from the log? y
[TRUNCATE_REC_WRAP] Truncate record at offset 1 in truncate log inode 38 starts at cluster 10000 and contains 4294967285 clusters.  It can't have this many clusters as that overflows the number of possible clusters in a volume.  Remove this record from the log? y
[TRUNCATE_REC_RANGE] Truncate record at offset 2 in truncate log inode 38 starts at cluster 4753 and contains 65546 clusters.  It can't have this many clusters as this volume only has 65536 clusters. Remove this record from the log? y

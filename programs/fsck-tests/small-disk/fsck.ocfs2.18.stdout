Pass 0a: Checking cluster allocation chains
Pass 0b: Checking inode allocation chains
[CHAIN_GROUP_BITS] Allocator inode 26 has 10 bits marked used out of 0 total bits but the chains have 0 used out of 0 total.  Fix this by updating the inode counts? y
[CHAIN_I_CLUSTERS] Allocator inode 26 has 0 clusters represented in its allocator chains but has an i_clusters value of 10. Fix this by updating i_clusters? y
[CHAIN_I_SIZE] Allocator inode 26 has 0 clusters represented in its allocator chain which accounts for 0 total bytes, but its i_size is 10. Fix this by updating i_size? y

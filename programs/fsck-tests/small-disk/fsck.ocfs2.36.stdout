@DEVICE@ was run with -f, check forced.
Pass 0a: Checking cluster allocation chains
Pass 0b: Checking inode allocation chains
Pass 0c: Checking extent block allocation chains
Pass 1: Checking inodes and blocks.
[LINK_NULLTERM] The target of symlink inode 16884 isn't null terminated.  Clear the inode? y
[INODE_ALLOC_REPAIR] Inode 16884 is marked as invalid but its position in the inode allocator is marked as in use.  Fix the allocation of this and all future inodes? y
[LINK_SIZE] The target of symlink inode 16885 is 16 bytes long on disk, but i_size is 26 bytes long.  Update i_size to reflect the length on disk? y
[INODE_CLUSTERS] Inode 16886 has 1 clusters but its blocks fit in 2 clusters.  Correct the number of clusters? y
[CLUSTER_ALLOC_BIT] Cluster 4734 is marked in the global cluster bitmap but it isn't in use.  Clear its bit in the bitmap? y
[CLUSTER_ALLOC_BIT] Cluster 4735 is marked in the global cluster bitmap but it isn't in use.  Clear its bit in the bitmap? y
[CLUSTER_ALLOC_BIT] Cluster 4738 is in use but isn't set in the global cluster bitmap. Set its bit in the bitmap? y
Pass 2: Checking directory entries.
[DIRENT_INODE_FREE] Directory entry 'test9AANYv' refers to inode number 16884 which isn't allocated, clear the entry? y
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity.
Pass 4a: checking for orphaned inodes
Pass 4b: Checking inodes link counts.
All passes succeeded.

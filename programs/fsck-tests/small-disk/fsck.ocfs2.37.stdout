@DEVICE@ was run with -f, check forced.
Pass 0a: Checking cluster allocation chains
Pass 0b: Checking inode allocation chains
Pass 0c: Checking extent block allocation chains
Pass 1: Checking inodes and blocks.
[ROOT_NOTDIR] Root inode isn't a directory.  Clear it in preparation for fixing it? y
[INODE_ALLOC_REPAIR] Inode 9 is marked as invalid but its position in the inode allocator is marked as in use.  Fix the allocation of this and all future inodes? y
[CLUSTER_ALLOC_BIT] Cluster 53 is marked in the global cluster bitmap but it isn't in use.  Clear its bit in the bitmap? y
Pass 2: Checking directory entries.
[DIRENT_INODE_FREE] Directory entry '..' refers to inode number 9 which isn't allocated, clear the entry? y
[DIRENT_INODE_FREE] Directory entry '..' refers to inode number 9 which isn't allocated, clear the entry? y
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity.
[ROOT_DIR_MISSING] The super block claims that inode 9 is the root directory but it isn't allocated.  Create a new root directory and update the super block? y
[LOSTFOUND_MISSING] /lost+found does not exist.  Create it so that we can possibly fill it with orphaned inodes? y
[DIR_NOT_CONNECTED] Directory inode 16881 isn't connected to the filesystem.  Move it to lost+found? y
[DIR_DOTDOT] Directory inode 16881 is referenced by a dirent in directory 16884 but its '..' entry points to inode 9. Fix the '..' entry to reference 16884? y
[DIR_NOT_CONNECTED] Directory inode 16882 isn't connected to the filesystem.  Move it to lost+found? y
[DIR_DOTDOT] Directory inode 16882 is referenced by a dirent in directory 16884 but its '..' entry points to inode 9. Fix the '..' entry to reference 16884? y
Pass 4a: checking for orphaned inodes
Pass 4b: Checking inodes link counts.
[INODE_COUNT] Inode 16884 has a link count of 2 on disk but directory entry references come to 4. Update the count on disk to match? y
All passes succeeded.

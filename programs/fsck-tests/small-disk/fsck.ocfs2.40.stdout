@DEVICE@ was run with -f, check forced.
Pass 0a: Checking cluster allocation chains
Pass 0b: Checking inode allocation chains
Pass 0c: Checking extent block allocation chains
Pass 1: Checking inodes and blocks.
Pass 2: Checking directory entries.
[DIRENT_ZERO] Directory entry has a zero-length name, clear it? y
[DIRENT_NAME_CHARS] Directory entry '/est' contains invalid characters, replace them with dots? y
[DIRENT_INODE_RANGE] Directory entry 'test' refers to inode number 262145 which is out of range, clear the entry? y
[DIRENT_INODE_FREE] Directory entry 'test' refers to inode number 17887 which isn't allocated, clear the entry? y
[DIRENT_TYPE] Directory entry test contains file type OCFS2_FT_SYMLINK (7) but its inode 16889 leads to type OCFS2_FT_REG_FILE (1).  Reset the entry's type to match the inode's? y
[DIRENT_DUPLICATE] Directory inode 16890 contains a duplicate occurance of the file name 'test'.  Replace this duplicate name with 'test_'? y
[DIRENT_LENGTH] Directory inode 16892 corrupted in logical block 0 physical block 18960 offset 32. Attempt to repair this block's directory entries? y
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity.
Pass 4a: checking for orphaned inodes
Pass 4b: Checking inodes link counts.
[INODE_COUNT] Inode 16891 has a link count of 1 on disk but directory entry references come to 2. Update the count on disk to match? y
[INODE_NOT_CONNECTED] Inode 16891 isn't referenced by any directory entries.  Move it to lost+found? y
